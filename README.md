# Lung Cancer Prediction
## Introduction 
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, primarily due to its late diagnosis and limited early detection methods. Early prediction and prevention of lung cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. Our group focus on three parts for this project. First, analyzing the association between different factors with lung cancer risk. Second, developing a predictive model for assessing lung cancer risk. Third, find the contribution of different variables to lung cancer

## Dependencies
-   Python **3.6+**

## Simplified Process
Step 1: Data acquisition
-   Study population was generated from patients with lung cancer, which included 1000 observations each for 24 variables(Kaggle.com).

Step 2: Data pre-processing
-   Detecting NA value and outliers using Z-score.
-   Assign the categorical variable risk level to 0, 1, 2
Step 3:
